SQL Challenge

Prework (create database to query easier):

CREATE DATABASE case_study;

USE case_study;

create table customers
(id INT,
country VARCHAR(50),
name VARCHAR(50),
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);


insert into customers (id, country, name) 
VALUES (1, 'DE', 'John Doe'),
(2, 'AT', 'John Snow'),
(3, 'DE', 'Johnny B. Goode');


create table orders
(id INT, 
number VARCHAR(50), 
country VARCHAR(50),
customer_id INT,
PRIMARY KEY (id),
KEY idx_fk_customer_id (customer_id),
CONSTRAINT fk_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

insert into orders (id, number, country, customer_id) 
Values (1, 'O-01', 'DE', 1),
(4, 'O-02', 'AT', 2),
(5, 'O-03', 'DE', 2),
(6, 'O-05', 'AT', 2),
(8, 'O-06', 'DE', 3),
(10, 'O-10', 'DE', 3),
(11, 'O-11', 'AT', 3),
(12, 'O-123', 'DE', 1);





Question 1:

with same1 as (select c.name as name, count(o.id) as same
from customers c
join orders o on o.customer_id = c.id and c.country = o.country
group by 1), 
different1 as (select c.name as name, count(o.id) as different
from customers c
join orders o on o.customer_id = c.id and c.country <> o.country
group by 1)
select name, same, COALESCE(different, 0) as different
from customers c
left join same1 s using(name)
left join different1 d using(name)
group by name;


Question 2:
select id +  1 as start, lead_ - 1 as end
from (select id, lead(id) over (order by id) as lead_, lead(id) over (order by id) - id as difference
from orders) t1
where difference > 1;


Question 3:

select clean_num + 1 as start, lead_ - 1 as end
from (select right(number, length(number) - 2) as clean_num, lead(right(number, length(number) - 2)) over (order by right(number, length(number) - 2)) as lead_, lead(right(number, length(number) - 2)) over (order by right(number, length(number) - 2)) - right(number, length(number) - 2) as difference
from orders) t1
where difference > 1;
